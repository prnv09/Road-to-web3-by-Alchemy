# Road-to-web3-by-Alchemy
In this repository you will find all the projects done by me in the 10 week program of 'Road to web3' organized by Alchemy

First Week Program - <br />
   We have minted NFT on the opensea testnet using the openzepplin, remix and filebase. <br />
   Openzepplin - this is a easy way to get started with your smart contract development.<br />
   Remix IDE - used for edit the solidity code.<br />
   Filebase- used to host the NFT file and NFT metadata on IPFS.<br />

The contract address on rinkeby testnet.<br />
